# Modal Implementation Complete

I have implemented the **Lead Form Modal** and updated the **Navigation Bar** to use it.

## Verification Steps
1.  Refresh `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  Click the **"Get Facility Audit"** button in the top navigation.
3.  A popup modal should appear with the request form.
4.  Submitting the form should redirect.

Hero section button remains scrolling to `#audit`.

**(Note: The system seems unable to call `notify_user` at this moment, so I am communicating via this file creation.)**
