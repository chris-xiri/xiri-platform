## 2. Conversion Flow Checklist

Every page must follow this narrative arc:
1.  **Headline**: State the Industry (e.g., "Ambulatory Surgery Centers").
2.  **Subhead**: The Promise ("Zero Deficiencies during your next audit").
3.  **Trust Bar**: "Serving [Location] since [Year]."
4.  **The "No" List**: "No missed shifts. No hidden fees. No unlicensed contractors."
5.  **CTA**: "Get Your Compliance Audit" (High value) vs "Get a Quote" (Low value).

## 3. Key Terminology (The "Style Guide")

| Instead of... | Use... |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Janitor** | **Environmental Services Technician** |
| **Cleaning** | **Infection Control** |
| **Check** | **Audit / Verify** |
| **Office** | **Facility / Suite / Center** |
| **Contract** | **Service Agreement** |

## 4. Execution Plan
*   **Hero Sections**: Rewrite for maximum authority.
*   **Service Cards**: Focus on *outcomes* (Patient Safety), not *features* (Mopping).
*   **About Us**: Focus on the "Night Manager" role (The Human Guarantee).
